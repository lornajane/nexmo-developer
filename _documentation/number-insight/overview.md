## Concepts

* [Webhooks](/concepts/guides/webhooks) - the Advanced Async API uses webhooks to return more comprehensive data when it becomes available.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:

* Sign up for a [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/signup)
* Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

> *Note*: If you do not wish to install Node in order to use the [Nexmo CLI](/tools) you can also create applications using the [Application API](/concepts/guides/applications)

Install and Setup the Nexmo CLI (Command Line Interface)

Install the Nexmo CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g nexmo-cli
```

> *Note*: depending on your system setup you may need to prefix the above command with `sudo`*

Using your Nexmo `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`, available from the [dashboard getting started page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide), you now setup the CLI with these credentials.

```bash
$ nexmo setup API_KEY API_SECRET
```

## Check your number using the Nexmo CLI

```bash
$ nexmo insight:basic 447555555555
```

See [Number Insight Basic](/number-insight/building-blocks/number-insight-basic) Building Block for details on how to use this in detail.
