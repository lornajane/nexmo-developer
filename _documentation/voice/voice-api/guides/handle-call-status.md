# Handle call status

Each time the status of Call or Conversation changes Nexmo sends a JSON object with information about the Call to the **event webhook endpoint** for your application.

The event webhook is defined in the following:

* Application configuration - [`POST /applications`](/api/application#create) - the default event webhook endpoint for all Calls and Conversations that use this application
* A Call request - [`POST /calls`](/api/voice#payload) - the event webhook endpoint used for a particular Call
* A [connect](/voice/guides/ncco-reference#connect) NCCO action - when you use the `connect` NCCO action to connect a voice call to an endpoint

A call can be initiated via a request to [`POST /calls`](/api/voice#payload). The response from this request contains initial information about the call.

```json
{
  "from": "447700900000",
  "to":  "447700900001",
  "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "conversation_uuid": "CON-bbbbbbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee-0123456789ab",
  "status": "started",
  "direction": "outbound",
  "timestamp": "2020-01-01T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Further status changes for the Call are sent to your `event_url` webhook endpoint. Each leg of a Call has a different `uuid`. The `uuid` is used in all [`/calls`](/api/voice#payload) requests that alter or retrieve information about a Call.

If you [record](/voice/guides/record-calls-and-conversations) your Calls and Conversations, the download URL for the mp3 recording is sent to your event webhook endpoint when `status` is `complete`.

The objects returned for the different Call status look like:

```tabbed_content

```

To inspect and debug state changes without writing your own server, use an online endpoint service such as [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/) or [hookbin.com](https://hookbin.com/).
