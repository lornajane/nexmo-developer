## Concepts

**Conversation**
    -> A conversation is a shared core component that Nexmo APIs rely on. Conversations happen over multiple mediums and and can have associated Users through Memberships.

**User**
    -> The concept of a user exists in Nexmo APIs, you can associate one with a user in your own application if you choose. A user can have multiple memberships to conversations and can communicate with other users through various different mediums.

**Member**
    -> Memberships connect users with conversations. Each membership has one conversation and one user however a user can have many memberships to conversations just as conversations can have many members.
