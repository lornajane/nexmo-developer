# How to do this simple thing

This section introduces what the building block does. Bear in mind a user could
land here from a search result so we may need to add a little context, redefine
abbreviations, or otherwise help them orient themselves.

## Example

Introduce the example, what are we about to do or see?

Before diving into the code samples, define the placeholders used by the code samples that will follow.  These should follow our [guidelines for placeholders](/contribute/guides/code-examples#placeholders) used throughout Nexmo Developer.

Key |	Description
-- | --
`NEXMO_NUMBER` | Nexmo Number to call.


```building_blocks
source: '_examples/concepts/sample-building-block'
application:
  name: 'Example Application'
```

## Try it out

What did the user just build?  How should they use it?  Add the instructions
for how to demo the masterpiece the user has just created.

## Further reading

Add resources for a user such as:

* A tutorial where this technique is used.
* Reference to either our own or external tools that might be handy.
* A guide for a similar topic (especially if that guide links to this building block).
