# Guides

The guides provide an in depth look into an actionable task such as "How do I send an SMS programmatically". The guides support the user through this problem in an opinionated, isolated way that follows best practice.

## Opening

Explain what the problem is and outline the steps that you'll take to overcome it in bullet points.

> Note: The opening has no heading as the heading should serve this purpose.

## Guide

Every guide has its own problem to solve. Use headings and sections that align with the steps one would take to overcome the problem.

## Conclusion

Point to resources:

* Tutorials - More in depth guides to support the user even further
* API Reference - Given that the guide is opinionated, provide this as a resource to allow the user to see what other options are available to them.
* Other relevant guides - Some guides are closely aligned, for example "Send an SMS" should suggest "Receive a delivery receipt" as further reading.

Reflect on:

* What you have done
* How you could extend on what you have learnt
