# Tutorials

Tutorials are complete example of how to build something practical. They are step-by-step and self-contained providing all necessary content inline and may combine many different products. They usually cover a single specific use case.

## Opening

Explain what the problem is and outline the steps that you'll take to overcome it in bullet points.

> Note: The opening has no heading as the heading should serve this purpose.

## Guide

Every tutorial has its own problem to solve. Use headings and sections that align with the steps one would take to overcome the problem.

## Conclusion

Reflect on:

* What you have done
* How you could extend on what you have learnt

Point to resources:

* Guides - Guides covering the concepts used in the tutorial.
* Building Blocks - cover specific bits of code to do single function operations.
* API Reference - Given that the tutorial is opinionated, provide this as a resource to allow the user to see what other options are available to them.
* Tutorials - Other relevant tutorials.
