# Building Blocks

Building blocks provide a quick reference to how to achieve a specific single concern task. They are designed to be easily readable and light on content to allow the user to context switch between the documentation and their codebase without too much distraction. Below you'll find a typical structure of how a building block should be structured.

**✅ Examples of when a building block is appropriate**

- How to send an SMS
- Making an outbound call
- Send verification code
- Get details about a phone number
- Buy a number

**❎ Examples of when a building block is not appropriate**

- Accepting an inbound call

    *This topic requires more setup than is appropriate for a building block and would more appropriately be a guide.*

- Two factor authentication

    *Although the components of this should be building blocks the subject in itself is too involved for a building block.*
