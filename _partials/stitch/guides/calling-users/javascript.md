# Call Convenience methods for Stitch and JavaScript

In this getting started guide we'll cover adding call methods to the Conversation we created in the [simple conversation with audio](/stitch/in-app-voice/guides/enable-audio/javascript) getting started guide. We'll deal with member call events that trigger on the application and call state events that trigger on the Call object.

## Concepts

This guide will introduce you to the following concepts.

- **Calls** - calling an User in your application without creating a Conversation first
- **Call Events** - `member:call` event that fires on an Application
- **Call Status Events** - `call:status:changed` event that fires on an Application when a status in the Call changes

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have run through the [previous guide](/stitch/in-app-voice/guides/enable-audio/javascript)

## 1 - Update the JavaScript App

We will use the application we already created for [the first audio getting started guide](/stitch/in-app-voice/guides/enable-audio/javascript). All the basic setup has been done in the previous guides and should be in place. We can now focus on updating the client-side application.

### 1.1 - Add call control UI

First, we'll add the UI for a user to call another user, and then see when it's being called. We'll also add UI in order to hang up the call. We'll hide the `call-incoming` and `call-members` using CSS until the user is interacting with a call. Let's add the UI at the top of the conversations area.

```html
  <style>
    #call-incoming, #call-members {
      display: none
    }
  </style>
  <section id="conversations">
    <form id="call-form">
      <h1>Call User</h1>
      <input type="text" name="username" value="">
      <input type="submit" value="Call" />
    </form>
    <div>
      <div id="call-incoming">
        <p></p><button id="yes">Yes</button><button id="no">No</button>
      </div>
      <div id="call-members">
        <p></p><button id="hang-up">Hang Up</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    ...
  </section>
```

And add the new UI in the class constructor

```javascript
constructor() {
  ...
  this.callForm = document.getElementById('call-form')
  this.callIncoming = document.getElementById('call-incoming')
  this.callMembers = document.getElementById('call-members')
  this.callYes = document.getElementById('yes')
  this.callNo = document.getElementById('no')
  this.hangUpButton = document.getElementById('hang-up')
}
```


### 1.2 - Add helper methods

We hid the `call-incoming` and `call-members` elements via CSS, so let's add `showCallIncoming(member)` and `showCallMembers(member)` as a helper methods to display the incoming call notification and add information about the members in a call:

```javascript
showCallIncoming(member) {
  var memberName
  if (member == "unknown") {
    memberName = "a phone"
  } else {
    memberName = member.user.name
  }
  this.callIncoming.style.display = "block"
  this.callIncoming.children[0].textContent = "Incoming call from " + memberName + ". Do you want to answer?"
}

showCallMembers(member) {
  var memberName
  if (member == "unknown") {
    memberName = "a phone"
  } else {
    memberName = member.user.name
  }
  this.callMembers.style.display = "block"
  this.callIncoming.style.display = "none"
  this.callMembers.children[0].textContent = "You are in a call with " + memberName
}
```

We've added some logic in the methods in order to identify the caller as a User in the application or a person calling from a phone. When we receive a phone call into our application, the member is listed as `unknown`.

### 1.3 - Add `member:call` listener

Next, we'll add a listener for `member:call` events on the app, so that we can let the user know when someone calls. We'll call the `showCallIncoming` method we just created, and that sets up the UI that allows a user to either `answer()` the incoming call or `hangsUp()`. If the user answers the call, the SDK automatically creates an `<audio>` element and passes the `stream` into it. So we'll have to call `showCallMembers` in order to display information about the call and a way to hang up the call. Let's update the `app` promise after `login(userToken)` with the code:

```javascript
...
.login(userToken)
.then(app => {
  ...
  this.app = app

  app.on("member:call", (member, call) => {
    this.call = call
    console.log("member:call - ", call);
    if ((this.call.from != "unknown") && (this.app.me.name != this.call.from.user.name)) {
      this.showCallIncoming(call.from)
    } else {
      this.showCallMembers("unknown")
    }
  })
})
```

### 1.4 - Add Call functionality

With these first parts we're listening `member:call` events on the application. Now let's see how to trigger those type of events, by making a call. Let's add an event listener for `callForm` inside the `setupUserEvents()` method. We'll take a list of user names from the input and pass those to the `call()` method on the Application object.

```javascript
setupUserEvents() {
  ...

  this.callForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    var usernames = this.callForm.children.username.value.split(",").map(username => username.trim())

    this.app.call(usernames)
  })
}
```

We'll also have to setup listeners for the other buttons we created in order to manage the call, so let's add them to `setupUserEvents()`.

```javascript
setupUserEvents() {
  ...

  this.hangUpButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    this.call.hangUp()
    this.callMembers.style.display = "none"
  })

  this.callYes.addEventListener('click', () => {
    this.call.answer()
    this.showCallMembers(this.call.from)
  })

  this.callNo.addEventListener('click', () => {
    this.call.hangUp()
    this.callIncoming.style.display = "none"
  })
}
```

If we want to be notified when the call status changes, we need to add a listener for `call:status:changed` on the Application. Let's update the `app` promise after `login(userToken)` with the code::

```javascript
...
.login(userToken)
.then(app => {
  ...

  app.on("call:status:changed", (call) => {
    console.log("call:status:changed - ", call.status)
  })
})
```

### 1.5 - Open the conversation in two browser windows

Now run `index.html` in two side-by-side browser windows, making sure to login with the user name `jamie` in one and with `alice` in the other. Call one from the other, accept the call and start talking. You'll also see events being logged in the browser console.

Thats's it! Your page should now look something like [this](https://github.com/Nexmo/stitch-js-quickstart/blob/master/calling-users/index.html).

### 1.6 - Calling a Stitch user from a phone

After you've set up you're app to handle incoming calls, you can follow the [PSTN to IP tutorial](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/05/13/connect-phone-call-to-stitch-in-app-voice-dr/) published on our blog to find out how you can connect a phone call to a Stitch user. Now you can make PSTN Phone Calls via the Nexmo Voice API and receive those calls via the Stitch SDK.

Because we've added logic in this quick start guide in order to differentiate between Users and PSTN phone calls, we don't need to change the quick start code, just set up an NCCO, as shown in the [PSTN to IP tutorial](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/05/13/connect-phone-call-to-stitch-in-app-voice-dr/).
