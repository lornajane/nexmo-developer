# Verify API Reference

You use Verify API to Verify that a phone number is valid, reachable, and accessible by your user. You can customise the message used during verification.

The endpoints for Verify API are:

* [Verify Request](#verify-request): generate and send a PIN to your user. You use the `request_id` in the [response](#rresponse) for the Verify Check.
* [Verify Check](#verify-check): confirm that the PIN you received from your user matches the one sent by Nexmo as a result of your [Verify Request](#verify-request).
* [Verify Search](#verify-search): lookup the status of one or more requests.
* [Verify Control](#verify-control): control the progress of your Verify Requests.

## Verify Request

To use Verify Request you:

* Create a [Request](#request) to send a PIN to your user.
* Check the response codes in the [Response](#response) to ensure that your request was successful.

### Request

```
[GET] https://api.nexmo.com/verify/:format
```

#### Parameters

The following table shows the parameters you use in the request:

Parameter | Description | Required
-- | -- | --
`format` | The response format. Either `json` or `xml` | Yes
`number` | The mobile or landline phone number to verify. Unless you are setting `country` explicitly, this number must be in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. For example, `447700900000`. | Yes
`country` | If do not set *number* in international format or you are not sure if *number* is correctly formatted, set `country` with the two-character country code. For example, *GB*, *US*. Verify works out the international phone number for you. | No
`brand` | The name of the company or App you are using Verify for.  This 18 character alphanumeric string is used in the body of Verify message. For example: "Your *brand* PIN is ..". |  Yes
`sender_id` | An 11 character alphanumeric string to specify the SenderID for SMS sent by Verify. Depending on the destination of the phone number you are applying, restrictions may apply. By default, `sender_id` is VERIFY.   |  No
`code_length` |  The length of the PIN. Possible values are 6 or 4 characters. The default value is 4. |  No
`lg` |  By default, the SMS or text-to-speech (TTS) message is generated in the locale that matches the *number*. For example, the text message or TTS message for a 33* number is sent in French. Use this parameter to explicitly control the [language and accent](#language-codes) used for the Verify request. The default language is `en-us`. |  No
`require_type` |  Restrict verification to a certain network type. Possible values are: <ul><li>All (Default)</li><li>Mobile</li><li>Landline</li></ul><br>**Note**: contact [support@nexmo.com](mailto:support@nexmo.com) to enable this feature. |  No
`pin_expiry` |  The PIN validity time from generation. This is an integer value between 60 and 3600 seconds. The default is 300 seconds. When specified together, pin_expiry must be an integer multiple of `next_event_wait`. Otherwise, pin_expiry is set to equal next_event_wait. For example: <ul><li>`pin_expiry` = 360 seconds, so `next_event_wait` = 120 seconds - all three attempts have the same PIN.</li><li>`pin_expiry` = 240 seconds, so `next_event_wait` = 120 seconds - 1st and 2nd attempts have the same PIN, third attempt has a different PIN.</li><li>`pin_expiry` = 120 (or 200 or 400 seconds) - each attempt has a different PIN.</li></ul> |  No
`next_event_wait` |  An integer value between 60 and 900 seconds inclusive that specifies the wait time between attempts to deliver the PIN. Verify calculates the default value based on the average time taken by users to complete verification. |  No
