### Top up

You can top-up your account using Developer API when you have enabled auto-reload in Dashboard. The amount added to your account at each top up is based on your initial reload-enabled payment. That is, if you topped up `€50.00` when you enabled auto-reload, `€50.00` is automatically credited to your account when your balance reaches `€20.00`.

Your account balance is checked every 6 minutes. If you are sending a lot of messages, use this API to manage reloads when remaining-balance in the response goes below a specific amount.
